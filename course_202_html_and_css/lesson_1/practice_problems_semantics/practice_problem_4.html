<!-- Given the following HTML, would <section>, <aside>, <article>, or <div> be the most appropriate element for the tag shown as <sometag>? -->

<sometag>
  <h3>Text-align Property</h3>
  <p>
    Given the width of the paragraph, the heading looks odd hanging out on
    the left side of the screen. Let's center it instead; we'll do this
    with the text-align property:
  <p>

  <pre>
    <h1 style="color: orange; text-align: center;">Hello, Internet!</h1>
  </pre>
</sometag>


<!-- Answer
A <section> tag might be the best choice.
The text appears to be part of a larger body of work, but it isn't a standalone block like an article.
It's also not an aside since it appears to be part of the main document flow.
