These practice problems focus on HTML and CSS that deal with text, like the font family, style, color, and size.

1. Create an HTML page with a single paragraph of text. Write CSS to set the font size for most elements on the page to 20px (you may ignore headers, subscripts, and other items that often have a different size).

2. Change the font family for the page from the previous problem to a sans-serif font.

3. Change the CSS for the previous problem to give the browser a choice one of three fonts (Tahoma, Trebuchet MS, Verdana), depending on what is available, before it uses the default sans-serif font.

4. Change the text from the previous problem to italic.

5. Change the CSS from the previous problem to boldface (keep the italics).

6. Change the CSS from the previous problem to increase the line height to 2.5 times its default height.

7. Change the CSS from the previous problem to a shorthand form that uses precisely one property. The output should not change.

8. Change the CSS from the previous problem to right-align the text within the paragraph:

9. Change the CSS from the previous problem to center-align the text within the paragraph:

10. Change the CSS from the previous problem to fully justify the text within the paragraph:

11. Change the CSS from the previous problem to indent the start of the paragraph by 4em.

12. Write the CSS needed to reproduce this screenshot:

<screenshot>

You should use this HTML:

<article>
  <header>
    <h1>Finessing `feColorMatrix`</h1>
  </header>
  <p>
    Harness the power of <code>feColorMatrix</code> to create detailed
    filters, with Una Kravets as your guide.
  </p>
</article>
The h1 heading uses the Georgia font while the code element uses the browser's default monospace font. The remaining text uses a 14px sans-serif font, with Helvetica and Arial preferred.

13. Change the CSS from the previous problem to display the h1 element text in blue, and the code text in green.

14. Write the CSS needed to reproduce this screenshot:

15. Example of completed problem

You should use this HTML:

<p>That episode was <mark>un<strong>be<em>lieve</em></strong>able</mark>!</p>
The font highlighted in yellow is Courier; use a backup font of monospace. The text uses four font sizes - 12px, 15px, 18px and 20px.

Create some HTML with this paragraph:

<p>
  The Creating Hyperlinks section of Getting to Know HTML discusses
  hyperlinks, or anchors. Be sure to work both "In Practice" sections; they
  pick up from where you left off in an earlier reading assignment.

Convert the text Getting to Know HTML to a hypertext link to this URL:

The link should open in a new browser tab or window. Add CSS to remove the underline and change the color to red.
