  <h1>Hello, Internet!</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to my website1 It's a work in progress and i'm just practicing some basic semantics.
    I'm learning <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> from <a href="https://www.launchschool.com">Launch School</a>.
    It's a long road learning all the skills of full stack web development, but it's a road i'll <em>keep</em> walking.

  <p class="brighten">
    There's a lot of material on this page as i'm playing around with HTML &amp; CSS. When i'm done,
    these last two pragraphs will take on a lighter color than the first - the "class" attribute on the two &lt;p&gt; and a bit of CSS will help accomplish that.
  </p>

  <p id="summery" class="brighten">
    This is the final paragraph. It also used the 'class' attribute as well an an 'id' attribute.
    We'll use some CSS and the 'id' attribute to underline the entire paragraph.
