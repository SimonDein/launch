Does the following statement use the DDL or DML component of SQL?

CREATE SEQUENCE part_number_sequence;

Answer:
DDL - The statement defines a sequence that is part of the definition of the database.
But it could be argued that in doing so the DDL statement inderectly defines data that will be inserted into the data base.
All things considered the statement in itself is DDL.
