Does the following statement use the DDL or DML component of SQL?

DROP DATABASE xyzzy;


Answer:
DDL (and inderectly DML) - The actual statement is using the DDL of SQL - altering (in this case deleting) a database.
But in doing so - all data in also manipulated (deleted). So inderectly the statement is also manipulating data in the database.
