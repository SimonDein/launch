Let's finish things up by dropping the database animals. With no tables in it, we don't have much use for it any more. Write a SQL statement or PostgreSQL command to drop the animals database.

DROP DATABASE animals;


CREATE TABLE tools (
id serial PRIMARY KEY,
name varchar(100) NOT NULL,
cost numeric(7, 2) NOT NULL,
price numeric (7,2) NOT NULL,
stock integer NOT NULL,
discount numeric (7,2) DEFAULT 0,
comments text
);
