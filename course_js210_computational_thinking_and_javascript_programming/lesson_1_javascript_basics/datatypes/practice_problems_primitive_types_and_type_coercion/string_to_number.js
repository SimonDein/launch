// The result of the following calculation is a string. Using type coercion, correct the calculation to produce the numeric result instead.

var x = '13';
var y = 9;

console.log(parseInt(x) + y);

// Using the same block of JavaScript, change the addition operator to a multiplication operator and leave x as a string. Will the result be a string or a number?

console.log(x * y);
