Given a year as an integer, return a string of the number and suffix of the century the integer belongs to.

Understand The Problem:
Input:
  An integer between 1 - many.

Output:
  A string of century number appenden with suffix.

Rules:
  A century is from 01 to 99
  A new century starts at 01 - fx 101 is the 2nd century

  Suffix:
    1: st
    2: nd
    3: 3rd
    4 - : th

    Exception
    11, 12, 13: th

Example and test cases:

1 => 1st
101 => 2nd
200 => 2nd
201 => 3rd
301 => 4th
1201 => 13th
2001 => 21st
2230 => 23rd

Data Structure:
We keep input as number as mainly need arithmetic operations to solve the problem.
Once we have the century number we can get the century suffix as a string.

Algorithm:
Get century number
  century: year / 100 ceiled
Get number suffix
  suffix:
    Get last two digits
      If last two digits in exceptions
        Return the suffix for exceptions
      Else
        Get last digit
        Return appropriate suffix for last digit
