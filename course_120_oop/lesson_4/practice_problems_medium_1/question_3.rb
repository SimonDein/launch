# In the last question Alyssa showed Alan this code which keeps track of items for a shopping cart application:

class InvoiceEntry
  attr_reader :quantity, :product_name

  def initialize(product_name, number_purchased)
    @quantity = number_purchased
    @product_name = product_name
  end

  def update_quantity(updated_count)
    quantity = updated_count if updated_count >= 0
  end
end

=begin
Alan noticed that this will fail when update_quantity is called. Since quantity is an instance variable, it must be accessed with the @quantity notation when setting it. One way to fix this is to change attr_reader to attr_accessor and change quantity to self.quantity.

Is there anything wrong with fixing it this way?

Answer:
No it's perfectly valid - though one thing to keep in mind is that if we do that we open up the possibility for any instance
of InvoiceEntry to directly change it's state through instance.quantity = <value> instead of 
going through the InvoiceEntry#update_quality method.
