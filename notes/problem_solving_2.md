# Approaching the Problem - start coding

## Overview

These notes / guidelines are for when you've got the initial mental model of the problem and / or broken down the problem (see [breaking down a problem - before you start coding](./problem_solving_1.md)).



*There are 3 skills you want to develop:*

 	1. **Problem solving with code**
     * You'll become faster and more fluent the more you practice
	2. **Refactoring**
    * Learning to program well is all about refactoring as you get a deeper understanding of the problem
    * Do not skip this step - learn to refactor and enjoy it!
	3. **Reading code**
    * You'll probably be working with a prewritten code base in your first job
    * Reading other peoples code is a great way to learn new ways of solving problems
    * Spend time *loading* their code into you head

These all apply to the `Approach` section below

## Approach

*You can follow this general guideline for approaching problems:*

1. **Understand the problem**                                                  **=> ` 1#_draft`** 

   The first draft is all about getting a deeper understanding of the problem - not pretty code

   ​

2. **Re-thing the problem** and refactor `1#_draft`              **=> ` #2_draft`**

   The problem should be well understood by now. Consider what you've learned about the problem domain and refactor accordingly

   ​

3. **Read other people's code** or brainstorm with others  **=> `#3_draft`**

   By now it's worth thinking about "pretty" code - i.e. well written, perfoming and succint code

   ​

4. **Analyze for performance** bottlenecks                             **=> `#4_draft`**

   This is not really in focus at this stage. But keep it in mind.
