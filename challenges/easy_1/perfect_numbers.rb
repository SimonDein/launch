Description:

The Greek mathematician Nicomachus devised a classification scheme for natural numbers, identifying each as belonging uniquely to the categories of abundant, perfect, or deficient.
A perfect number equals the sum of its positive divisors â€” the pairs of numbers whose product yields the target number, excluding the number itself.
This sum is known as the Aliquot sum.

Perfect: Sum of factors == number
Abundant: Sum of factors > number
Deficient: Sum of factors < number
Examples:

6 is a perfect number because its divisors are 1, 2, 3 and 6 = 1 + 2 + 3.
28 is a perfect number because 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14.
Prime numbers 7, 13, etc are deficient by the Nicomachus classification.
Write a program that can tell if a number is perfect, abundant or deficient.

Input:
  - Integer

Output:
  - String

Data-structure:
  - Input should be stored as original integer
  - An accumulator in the form of an integer can be used to sum the divisors
