=begin
In the previous exercise, we wrote a method that emulates Enumerable#each_cons, but limited our method to handling 2 elements at a time.
Enumerable#each_cons can actually handle any number of elements at a time: 1, 2, 3, or more.

Update your each_cons method so it takes an argument that specifies how many elements should be processed at a time.
=end

def each_cons(arr, n) # iterates the array passing n number of consecutive objects to the block at a time
  index = 0
  while index + n <= arr.size
    yield(*arr[index, n]) # unpack so single elements are passed as an element instead of an array holding a single entry.
    index += 1
  end
  nil
end

hash = {}
each_cons([1, 3, 6, 10], 1) do |value|
  hash[value] = true
end
puts hash == { 1 => true, 3 => true, 6 => true, 10 => true }

hash = {}
each_cons([1, 3, 6, 10], 2) do |value1, value2|
  hash[value1] = value2
end
puts hash == { 1 => 3, 3 => 6, 6 => 10 }

hash = {}
each_cons([1, 3, 6, 10], 3) do |value1, *values|
  hash[value1] = values
end
puts hash == { 1 => [3, 6], 3 => [6, 10] }

hash = {}
each_cons([1, 3, 6, 10], 4) do |value1, *values|
  hash[value1] = values

puts hash == { 1 => [3, 6, 10] }
